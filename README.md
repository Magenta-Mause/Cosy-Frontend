# COSY Frontend

## After cloning this Repository

In order to get you started developing the COSY frontend, please make sure you follow these steps:

### 1. Bun Installation

We use `bun` as our runtime & bundler. For the installation, proceed as follows, depending on your operating system:

#### macOS / Linux

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash
```

#### Windows

```sh
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

#### npm

```sh
npm install -g bun
```

You may need to restart your terminal/command line after installation to make sure bun is available to you.

If you encounter any issues, feel free to consult the [bun documentation](https://bun.com/docs/installation) or ask in
the GC :)

### 2. Package Installation

We make use of various libraries to make our life easier (duh). Before starting development or behold - trying to start
the project, please install all dependencies using the following command:

```sh
bun i
```

### 3. VS Code Setup

While you are technically ready to [start/build the frontend](#), you might want to make your development experience
better by following these vs code integrations:

- Install the [Biome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) extension for code linting /
  formatting support
- Install the [TailwindCSS LintelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
  extension for tailwind class intellisense
- Install
  the [React/Redux/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets)
  extensions which allows you to automatically generate boilerplate component code by typing `tsrfce`

## Starting / Building

To run the frontend with hot-reloading, please run:

```sh
bun run dev
```

If you want to create a final build (why would you want that on your local machine?), run:

```sh
bun run build
```

or with minimization + code splitting:

```sh
bun run build:opt
```

and then start your production build as follows:

```sh
bun run start
```

### Using ShadCN/ui components

In order to use ShadCN/ui we have to first pull them into our repository. To do this,
visit [https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components)
to get an overview over the available components.

You can then view the documentation (configuration / usage) for individual components and obtain a installation command
that should look something like this:

```sh
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add button
```

Running this command in the repositorys root directory will install the component (e.g. `button.tsx`) into the
`./src/components/ui/` directory.
You can now import the component by importing from `@components/ui/[component name].tsx`.

The advantage of using ShadCN is that you can freely modify components if you wish to. Please remember to create a copy
of the `[component name].tsx` if you do not
wish all components of the type to be affected by your modification.

Please place any modified components under `./src/components/custom/[modified component name].tsx` in order to separate
pure ShadCN components from modified ones.

### API Client Generation (Orval)

We use Orval to automatically generate TypeScript types and React Query hooks from our backend.

If the backend API has been updated, you need to sync the changes to the frontend manually:

1. Make sure your backend is running locally.
2. Copy the raw JSON content from `http://localhost:8080/api/v3/api-docs`.
3. Paste the content into the local `./openapi-backend.json` file.
4. Run the generation command:
   ```sh
   bunx orval
   ```

**Pro Tip:** If you are on Mac/Linux (or use Git Bash), you can do this in one line:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v3/api-docs > openapi-backend.json && bunx orval
```

### Common Pitfalls

#### Tanstack Router Error

Hot reloading for new routes does not work currently. When you run `bun run dev`, tanstack router generates a new route
tree for you which should fix the issue.
If you need to regenerate the route tree while bun is running in development mode, please execute:

```sh
bun run tsr:gen
```

to regenerate the route tree.
